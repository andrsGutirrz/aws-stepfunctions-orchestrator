# Claude Code Prompt: Serverless Step Functions with Docker + GitHub Actions

Create a complete AWS serverless application with the following specifications:

## Project Requirements

**Architecture:**
- 3 AWS Lambda functions orchestrated by AWS Step Functions
- EventBridge trigger to start the Step Functions workflow
- Docker container images for Lambda deployment (not ZIP files)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployment
- AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
- Terraform for infrastructure as code

**Lambda Functions:**
- Lambda 1: Print "Hello" and pass data to next lambda
- Lambda 2: Print "World" and pass data to next lambda  
- Lambda 3: Print ":)" and return final result
- All lambdas should use external packages: `openai` and `google-api-python-client`
- Lambdas use uv as package manager

**Configuration Management:**
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID)
- Use Lambda environment variables for non-sensitive config
- Support local development with .env files and python-dotenv
- Hybrid approach: load .env locally, use AWS Secrets Manager in production

**Repository Structure:**
```
my-serverless-app/
├── .github/workflows/
│   └── deploy.yml
├── src/
│   ├── lambda1/
│   ├── lambda2/
│   └── lambda3/
├── terraform/
├── scripts/
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
└── requirements-dev.txt
```

## Specific Implementation Details

**Docker Images:**
- Each lambda should have its own Dockerfile using `public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12`
- Include requirements.txt with openai and google-api-python-client packages
- Optimize for Lambda container image best practices

**Terraform Infrastructure:**
- ECR repositories for each lambda image
- Lambda functions using container images
- Step Functions state machine with proper error handling and retries
- EventBridge rule to trigger Step Functions (can be schedule-based for demo)
- AWS Secrets Manager secret with sample keys
- All necessary IAM roles and policies with least privilege
- Output important ARNs and URLs

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
- Trigger on push to main branch
- Build and push Docker images to ECR
- Deploy infrastructure with Terraform
- Include proper AWS credentials configuration
- Add workflow for both staging and production environments

**Security & Best Practices:**
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use AWS IAM least privilege principles
- Include error handling and retries in Step Functions
- Add CloudWatch logging configuration
- Include X-Ray tracing for debugging

**Local Development:**
- Instructions for running locally with LocalStack or AWS SAM
- Scripts for easy local testing
- Clear setup instructions in README

**Python Code Requirements:**
- Each lambda handler should demonstrate reading from AWS Secrets Manager
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Pass data between lambdas through Step Functions input/output
- Use boto3 for AWS services interaction

## Deliverables

Generate all necessary files including:
1. Complete Terraform configuration with all resources
2. Dockerfile for each lambda function
3. Python handler code for all 3 lambdas
4. GitHub Actions workflow file
5. Step Functions state machine definition
6. Development scripts and utilities
7. Comprehensive README with setup instructions
8. .env.example template
9. .gitignore with appropriate exclusions
10. requirements.txt files for each lambda

assume I have aws cli and terraform programs installed in system.

Make sure the solution is production-ready with proper error handling, security, and monitoring capabilities.
